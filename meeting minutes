Project Management:
  Impediments to progress:
    Not enough information. The system architecture is not clear.
    University is reluctant to give information:
      Only allowed to use the name of the router.
      We will only have access to 2 routers.
      We wont have access to mac addresses.
      Network:
        Hoping for access to API (aruba) which is the universities wifi management entity. API will give us access to figure out location of people and flow map.
      Security:
        Dont want to give us details of their system.
    
  Recommendations:
    We need clarification on what data we will have access to.
    We need clarification on what other subsystems will require from us.
    Who will be pulling and who will be pushing. This can be provided with a component diagram.
    We could consult the integration team for clarification on the inter subsystem APIs.
    To get any work done in the light of uncertainty and incomplete information we will have to make assumptions.
      We assume that we will get user location data tied with persistent ID.

  Vision for the mock demo:
    Not clear yet. Hopefully on friday.

  Decisions made:
    Draft a document of question for the client on friday.
    Startup slack group.
