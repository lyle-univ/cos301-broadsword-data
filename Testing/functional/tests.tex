{Running Apache Flink with defined data sink}
{For this test I ran Apache Flink code that I got from the Gladios Data team's repository.The system's defined data sink is \textbf{\textit{  text.map(new Mapper()).writeAsText("C:/Users/rob/Documents/NetBeansProjects/COS301/test.txt");}} but this line will only work on one computer and did not run when we tested it. As can be seen in \textbf{Figure 1}, the reason why the file directory cannot be found is because it is only specified for one computer.

{Running Flink after changing data sink}
{For this test I ran Apache Flink code but I changed the data sink to \textbf{\textit{  text.map(new Mapper()).writeAsText(/"tmp/test.txt");}}, so that the system can run on any computer. After changing the data source the system runs without any error and returns a devices location in the text file, as can be seen in \textbf{Figure 2}.As a side note is shows that the result is the Longitude and Latitude but it is actually the x and y values relative to the access point.

{Running flink without starting the Job Manager}
{This test will see if Apache Flink runs and returns the relevant information without starting the Job Manager. Flink does run without a Job Manager and returns the same result which can be seen in Figure 2 of the previous test.}
