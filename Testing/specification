Functional Requirements
	1.	Get device location given mac address
		a.	Test if there is error handling for malformed queries 
		b.	Test if the system breaks if a mac address that is not connected to the network is given
		c.	Does the system handle requests to the system with a valid mac address?
	2.	Does the ALE work 
		a.	Test if the system works when connected to the network
		b.	Test if the system can display an error if it cannot connect to the system
	3.	Does Apache Flink work
		a.	Does the system run with Apache Flink?
		b.	Does it handle failure to connect to Flink i.e. Does streaming work if the job manager is not running 
	4.	Does the system handle data streaming?

Non-Functional Requirements
	1.	Does the system keep the ALE secure?
	2.	Does the system implement some form of concurrency? 
		a.	Since the system is continuously writing to a text file, is some form of concurrency in place to handle reading and writing to the text file whilst keeping the data consistent 
	3.	Does the system have a deployment framework in place for external entities to use?
















Example of what output document might look like 


1 Functional Requirements
	1.1 Does Apache Flink work
		1.1.1 Description
			Give a description of that this test is and list all the tests that will be
			conducted
		1.1.2 Severity
			Describe how the tests turned out and if the outcome was expected i.e Do
			this for each test that was specified
		1.1.3 Mark
			Give a mark out of 10 base of the severity
		1.1.4 Steps to reproduce
			List the steps that you followed to perform each test e.g.
			
			Test 1
				Step 1: Started Apache Flink..


The above example is just a possible solution of how it might look and is not the final style. It can change of someone has a better way to implement it
