Note that to see the agile workflow with kanban cards, you need zenhub. Checkout wip for the most recent work.
## Worflow conventions:
- Take work from the backlog and when completed move it to review. Then a team mate will review it and move it to done and close the issue. Rinse and repeat.
- Feature freeze commences on 18 Apr 00:00
- Total freeze commences on 19 Apr 00:00
- Bleeding edge work goes into the wip branch
- If a feature is completed merge into feature
- Stable versions get merged into master
- If a bug needs fixing merge into bug, fix it and merge back in to the branch where the bug occured
- Epics contain mutiple stories that need to be completed for each milestone
